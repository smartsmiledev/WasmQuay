//! A tiny, dependency-free JSON value model and serializer.
//!
//! The toolkit emits machine-readable reports but does not pull in `serde`
//! (to keep the offline, zero-dependency promise). This module provides an
//! ordered [`Json`] value type and a deterministic pretty/compact printer.
//!
//! Object keys preserve insertion order so diffs between report runs are
//! stable and readable.
