//! # wasmquay-core
//!
//! Offline, zero-dependency core for inspecting WebAssembly components and
//! evaluating capability policies.
//!
//! The crate is organized as a pipeline:
//!
//! 1. [`leb`] — primitive byte / LEB128 decoding.
//! 2. [`wasm`] — the WebAssembly binary decoder (header, sections, imports,
//!    exports, custom `name` section).
//! 3. [`wit`] — a reader for wasmquay's WIT-like interface manifest subset.
//! 4. [`policy`] — capability classification and explicit policy evaluation.
//! 5. [`compat`] — substitutability comparison between two components.
//! 6. [`report`] — stable JSON/text serialization consumed downstream.
//! 7. [`fixture`] — a matching binary *encoder* for deterministic test data.
//!
//! ## Scope & honesty
//!
//! wasmquay performs **static inspection and policy analysis**. It decodes the
//! binary and reasons about the capability surface a component declares through
//! its imports. It is **not** a WebAssembly runtime: it does not execute
//! modules, instantiate them, or enforce capabilities at run time. Where the
//! documentation talks about "enforcement" it means *analysis against a stated
//! policy*, not sandbox interception.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```
//! use wasmquay_core::{fixture::FixtureBuilder, wasm, policy, report};
//!
//! // Synthesize a module that imports a clock and a socket.
//! let bytes = FixtureBuilder::new()
//!     .module_name("svc")
//!     .import_func("wasi_snapshot_preview1", "clock_time_get")
