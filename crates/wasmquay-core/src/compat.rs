//! Component compatibility comparison.
//!
//! Given two components (parsed modules and/or manifests) wasmquay computes a
//! substitutability report: can component *B* stand in for component *A*?
//!
//! The rule of thumb, borrowed from structural typing, is:
//!
//! * **Exports** are contravariant for the consumer: B must export at least
//!   everything A exports (B may export more).
//! * **Imports** are covariant for the host: B must not require any host
//!   capability that A did not already require (B may require fewer).
//!
//! We compare on the (name, kind) identity of exports and on the classified
//! capability domain plus source for imports.
